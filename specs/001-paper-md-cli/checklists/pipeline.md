# Pipeline Requirements Checklist: Paper-to-Markdown CLI

**Purpose**: Validate that the core PDF→markdown conversion requirements are complete, clear, and measurable before authors iterate on them.
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: specs/001-paper-md-cli/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all CLI inputs/outputs (PDF path, output directory, required artifacts such as markdown, manifest, crops, evaluation report) enumerated so no stage is implicit? [Completeness, Spec §US1, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK002 Do the requirements explicitly describe persistence expectations for intermediate artifacts (TEI cache, rasterized pages, asset crops) needed by downstream steps? [Completeness, Spec §US1 Acceptance, Spec §FR-002–FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 Is the reconciliation contract (how TEI structure, OCR text, and detected assets combine) fully described so implementers know every output of the merge? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005–FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is the directive “merge OCR text with the GROBID scaffold” backed by concrete rules for conflict resolution and logging severity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the asset-count parity requirement explicit about whether mismatches are fatal, tolerated, or logged-only? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK006 Does the checksum verification requirement define when verification occurs and the exact response to a mismatch? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories, functional requirements, and plan/task sequencing all describe the same pipeline order (GROBID → rasterize → Qwen3-VL OCR/assets → reconcile → markdown → evaluation)? [Consistency, Spec §US1, Spec §FR-001–FR-009, Plan §Summary, Tasks §Phase 3]
- [ ] CHK008 Are performance statements (≤10 min end-to-end, ≤30 s per page) consistent wherever they appear so authors do not introduce competing targets later? [Consistency, Spec §SC-004, Spec §NFR-001, Tasks §Phase N]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Do the Independent Test sections specify observable pass/fail signals (e.g., exit code, manifest shape) for each story so they can serve as acceptance criteria? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §US1–US3]
- [ ] CHK010 Are measurable outcomes SC-001–SC-003 clearly tied to the automation hooks described in FR-010 so authors can trace how each metric will be validated? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001–SC-003, Spec §FR-010]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are service-outage scenarios (GROBID, Qwen3-VL) described with required user messaging and recovery expectations beyond “fail fast”? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-002, Spec §NFR-003]
- [ ] CHK012 Are retry/timeout behaviors or explicit deferrals documented for each external call so failure handling is not left to implementation guesswork? [Coverage, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Assumptions]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Do requirements define how stitched multi-page figures/tables are labeled and linked back into markdown references? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK014 Are streaming expectations for very large PDFs documented for every pipeline stage (rasterization, OCR, asset detection) rather than only in general terms? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Plan §Phase 0 Item 3]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are logging/audit requirements captured for each external interaction so troubleshooting data is guaranteed? [Non-Functional, Spec §NFR-002]
- [ ] CHK016 Is the resource-usage expectation for running Qwen3-VL twice per page (assets + OCR) specified or intentionally left open for later clarification? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §NFR-001]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are assumptions about local availability of Qwen3-VL and GROBID paired with readiness checks or documented fallback plans? [Dependencies, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK018 Is the cryptographic algorithm used for manifest checksums identified so downstream tooling can interoperate? [Dependencies, Gap, Spec §FR-011]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK019 Does the TEI caching requirement clarify reuse vs regeneration semantics to avoid stale scaffolds across runs? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK020 Is the boundary between manifest warnings and hard failures for detected anomalies documented so different teams interpret severity consistently? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-008, Spec §SC-002]
