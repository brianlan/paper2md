Readability Over Cleverness\nCode exists for humans first, so every contribution MUST optimize clarity and future comprehension.\n- Prefer explicit control flow, descriptive naming, and straightforward data shapes over \"magic\".\n- Reject clever shortcuts that hide intent or couple unrelated concerns.\n- Document non-obvious constraints adjacent to the code so reviewers never guess.\nRationale: Clear code shortens onboarding time, reduces bug risk, and enables confident refactors.\n\n### II. Test-Driven Delivery\nEvery feature begins with a failing test that captures the desired behavior before implementation.\n- Follow Red → Green → Refactor with no skipping; untested code cannot merge.\n- Use mocks/stubs for external services so tests run locally and deterministically.\n- Keep tests descriptive enough that they double as executable documentation of intent.\nRationale: TDD provides proof of correctness, allows safe change, and anchors discussions on behavior.\n\n### III. Relentless Automation\nAnything repeatable MUST be automated so engineers spend time on solving problems, not running checklists.\n- Linting, formatting, unit/integration suites, and documentation checks run in CI for every PR.\n- Local scripts mirror CI to avoid \"works on my machine\" drift.\n- Breaking the build blocks merges until automation is green; manual overrides are prohibited without\n  written approval in the PR.\nRationale: Automation enforces consistency, accelerates feedback, and prevents regressions.\n\n### IV. Intentional Simplicity\nSolutions stay as small as possible while honoring KISS, DRY, SOLID, and YAGNI.\n- Build only what the current user story requires; defer speculative hooks.\n- Extract shared behavior once it is duplicated twice, not preemptively.\n- Design APIs and modules with single responsibilities and clear extension seams.\nRationale: Simplicity reduces maintenance cost and keeps the codebase malleable.\n\n### V. Explain the Why\nComments, docs, and commit messages MUST capture reasoning, not narration.\n- Write comments only where intent or tradeoffs would be unclear without context.\n- Reference decisions, constraints, or rejected alternatives with links to specs or tickets.\n- Update comments whenever behavior changes so they never drift from reality.\nRationale: Understanding the \"why\" accelerates reviews, debugging, and onboarding.\n\n## Delivery Workflow Standards\n- Start every change by writing or updating failing tests that describe the behavior and mock all\n  external touchpoints.\n- Push small, reviewable commits that each include both the tests and the implementation that makes\n  them pass.\n- Keep automation scripts (lint, test, format, docs) in the repo and reference them from plans and\n  tasks so every engineer runs the same commands.\n- Capture rationale for deviations (e.g., unavoidable coupling) directly in the PR description and\n  link to the relevant comment blocks in code.\n\n## Review & Quality Gates\n- Code review blocks merge until readability, TDD evidence, and automation results are all verified.\n- Reviewers confirm every change references the tests that cover it and that mocks/stubs keep tests\n  hermetic.\n- CI must prove lint, unit, integration, and docs checks succeed; failures are never ignored.\n- Review checklists call out readability, simplicity, and rationale to ensure the constitution stays\n  enforceable.\n\n## Governance\n- This constitution supersedes informal practices; feature plans, specs, and tasks MUST cite how they\n  satisfy each principle.\n- Amendments require: (1) written proposal in the repo, (2) approval from at least two maintainers,\n  (3) documented migration steps if behavior changes.\n- Versioning follows SemVer: MAJOR for principle changes/removals, MINOR for new sections/principles,\n  PATCH for clarifications.\n- Compliance is reviewed during quarterly retros; gaps result in tracked remediation tasks within the\n  backlog.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-07 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-07\nEOF"],"workdir":"/home/rlan/projects/paper2md"}

 ## Constitution Check
 
 *GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
 
-[Gates determined based on constitution file]
+- `Readable-first design`: Planned components use explicit naming, straightforward control flow, and
+  describe how intent will stay obvious in the code.
+- `TDD-first workflow`: Outline the failing tests that will be written first plus the mocks/stubs
+  used to isolate external services.
+- `Automation coverage`: Identify the lint/test/docs scripts (local + CI) that will enforce the
+  change and confirm they run as part of this feature.
+- `Intentional simplicity`: Explain how the scope honors KISS/DRY/SOLID/YAGNI and defers speculative
+  work until another story demands it.
+- `Explain the why`: Call out design tradeoffs and reference where rationale-focused comments or
+  ADRs will live so reviewers have context.
